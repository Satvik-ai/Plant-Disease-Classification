# Plant Disease Classification

## Image Classification, Python(TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Numpy), FastAPI

• Developed a CNN model for plant disease classification using leaf images.
• Preprocessed images (resizing, augmentation, normalization) to enhance model performance.
• Developed a FastAPI-based backend for model deployment and API integration.
• Achieved an accuracy of more than 98% in the classification of plant diseases.

## Backend

To start the backend go to the API folder, open terminal and follow the below given steps 

1. Install virtualenv:
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```
$ virtualenv env
```

3. Install required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the backend
```
python main.py
```

## Frontend

To start the frontend go the Frontend folder, open terminal and follow the below given steps

1. Install npm
```
npm install
```

2. Start the frontend
```
npm run dev
```
