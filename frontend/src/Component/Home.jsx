            Plants play a crucial role in supplying food globally. Various
            environmental factors lead to plant diseases which results in
            significant production losses. However, manual detection of plant
            diseases is a time-consuming and error-prone process due to the fact
            that symptoms are not always apparent, either through visual
            inspection or computer¬†analysis. It can be an unreliable method of
            identifying and preventing the spread of¬†plant¬†diseases. Emergence
            of accurate techniques in the field of leaf based image
            classification has shown impressive¬†results.

              disease present in plants in a¬†colossal¬†scale.
